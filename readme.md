## Downloading Spectra from one EMIT pixel
There are methods like AρρEEARS for downloading data like this. But often find it pretty slow. Here is a very simple method that can allow fast extraction of spectra from EMIT to a csv for one pixel with no coding experience (see `get_EMIT_pixel.ipynb`)

- takes input of latitude and longitude of your site

Requirements:
- use miniconda or other to install the env (`env.yml`)
- have or create an earthaccess login
